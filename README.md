# DeliverTrack

DeliverTrack is a web application that allows users to track the status of their orders delivered by an automated robot in real time. The application is built using the NERP stack with microservices in the Backend (Node.js, Express, Redis, PostgreSQL), and Svelte and React for different user and client apps in the frontend.
